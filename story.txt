One upon a time in Madison, WI...

There was a professional wrestler who also happened to be a bear.
As the bear was getting prepared for battle it decided that it 
was hungry. Luckily, outside the stadium there was some fresh 
salmon. It ate the salmon. 

Although the bear thought the salmon tasted really good, it sort of gave him  a stomach ache. The bear wasn't sure if that was the salmon or something else he had before. Regardless, he had a battle to be prepared for, and his stomach ache was the least of his problems

One upon a time in Madison, WI...

There was a professional wrestler who also happened to be a bear.
As the bear was getting prepared for battle it decided that it 
was hungry. Luckily, outside the stadium there was some fresh 
salmon. It ate the salmon. 

Although the bear thought the salmon tasted really good, it sort of gave him  a stomach ache. The bear wasn't sure if that was the salmon or something else he had before. Regardless, he had a battle to be prepared for, and his stomach ache was the least of his problems 
mkdir x2
exit

Suddenly, linux commands started coming out of the sky and flying towards the bear. At first, the bear did not know what to do.
His stomach ache made it difficult for him to think clearly. With some effort, the bear finally stood up on his back legs and
faced towards the ever approaching "mkdir x2" and "exit." There was only one thing going through his head. The one thing the
bear spent his entire life doing: fight.
